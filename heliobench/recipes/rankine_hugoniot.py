# name: rankine_hugoniot
# description: Rankine-Hugoniot analysis of a collisionless shock. Derives the upstream/downstream averaging windows from the shock time itself, then computes compression ratio, shock speed and Mach numbers, and checks them against each other.
# inputs: shock_time (numpy datetime64), and per quantity a (time, values) pair — magnetic field magnitude nT, proton density cm-3, bulk speed km/s, temperature eV (optional). Each may have its own cadence.
# outputs: V_shock (km/s, spacecraft frame), r (density compression ratio), plus the windows used and a consistency verdict
# reference: Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions (Rankine 1870; Hugoniot 1887); for collisionless shocks see Schwartz (1998), ISSI SR-001, ch. 10 — including the averaging-window guidance this recipe implements.

"""Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions for a collisionless shock.

Applies the conservation laws across the shock:
  1. Mass flux:         r = n_d / n_u  (compression ratio)
  2. Momentum flux:     n m (V - V_sh)^2 + P conserved
  3. Magnetic flux:     B_d / B_u = r  (perpendicular shock, exact)

**This recipe picks the averaging windows itself, and that is the point.** Choosing them
by hand is where the analysis actually goes wrong: one run averaged the downstream side
from shock+30 min out to shock+120 min, landing in the decaying sheath rather than the
shocked plasma. Density came out 32 cm-3 instead of 45, the compression ratio 1.89
instead of 2.59, and the Alfvenic Mach number 4.6 instead of 3.2 — every downstream
number wrong, from one plausible-sounding choice. Do not pass your own averages.

Usage: load_recipe("rankine_hugoniot") returns this source. Paste it into run_python and
call, with each quantity on its own time base (B is typically 3 s, plasma moments 92 s):

    n_u, n_d = upstream_downstream(t_n, n, shock_time)
    V_u, V_d = upstream_downstream(t_v, v, shock_time)
    B_u, B_d = upstream_downstream(t_b, bmag, shock_time)
    T_u, T_d = upstream_downstream(t_t, t_ev, shock_time)
    V_shock, r = rh_jump(n_u=n_u, n_d=n_d, V_u=V_u, V_d=V_d, B_u=B_u, B_d=B_d, T_u=T_u, T_d=T_d)

Recommended pipeline when the shock normal is known:

    theta_bn or mvab -> n_hat -> upstream_downstream(t_v, v, shock_time, normal=n_hat)

V_shock comes back FIRST — this example used to read `r, V_shock`, which silently
swapped a 579 km/s speed with a compression ratio of 2.59.

V_shock is in the spacecraft frame, derived from mass-flux conservation. Two things
follow. Do not use V_d * r/(r-1) instead: it assumes the upstream plasma is at rest,
and against a 400 km/s solar wind it overestimates by ~45%. And the Alfvenic Mach
number needs the shock speed in the UPSTREAM frame, (V_shock - V_u)/V_A — dividing
the spacecraft-frame speed by V_A gives a number several times too large.

# within the hour, and averaging into that decay is what drags the downstream state down.
#
# These are measured, not assumed. Sweeping both against the 2015-03-17 shock and scoring

# The published compression for this event is 2.59. A generous guard with a long span
# is the worst combination and the most plausible-sounding one, which is exactly how a
# run reported 1.89.
#
# HONEST LIMITATION: that sweep is one event. A second shock (2012-07-14) was tried and
# was inconclusive — Wind plasma moments there are ~3 min apart, so most windows caught
# fewer than three samples and `window_mean` correctly refused to average them. So these
# are CALIBRATED, not derived: they suit a fast forward shock at L1 sampled at 92 s.
# For a slower or weaker shock, or a coarser instrument, sweep them again on your own
# event and score on the r_n vs r_B agreement, which needs no published answer. They are
# arguments for a reason — pass your own rather than trusting these.
#
# VELOCITY NORMAL PROJECTION: with normal=None, `upstream_downstream` averages |V|. That is
# a good approximation while the shock normal is nearly aligned with the flow (the usual case
# for a fast forward shock at L1) and degrades as 1/cos(theta_Vn) — about +40% on V_shock at
# 45 deg. Pass normal=n_hat from theta_bn or mvab to project V·n̂ instead.
