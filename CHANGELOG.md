## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `Trace`, the only thing graders may read, with exact token accounting
  recovered by wrapping the provider SDK call (HelioAI discards `response.usage`).
- `Agent` protocol and the HelioAI adapter: environment pinned before import, offline
  replay by seeding a session's workspace, preflight that refuses to run against an
  unreachable search index.
- Repository skeleton: packaging, licence, citation metadata, CI, datasheet outline.
- `heliobench list` and the YAML task schema.
